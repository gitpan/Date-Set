Revision history for Perl extension Date::Set.

1.23_10
    clear string warnings in Date::Set::ICal

1.23_09
    uses native "Infinity" stringification

1.23_08
    fixed some warnings

1.23_07
    wkst() is a method too (was global)

1.23_03
    DTSTART is not taken from the period, it must be given by a
        dtstart parameter or by 'DTSTART=xx' inside a rule.
    AT syntax was changed to make it compatible with what new() expects:
        at => [ '19971024T120000Z', '19971025T120000Z' ] );   # a period (was two events)
    but this didn't change:
        at => [ ['19971024T120000Z'], ['19971025T120000Z'] ] );  # two events
        at => [ ['19971024T120000Z', '19971025T120000Z'] ] );    # a period 
    Some tests changed due to new semantics
    More tests
    Removed .pl extension from make_readme and make_htmldoc because they
        were being "installed" to site/lib/Date
    No changes were necessary in t/rfc2445.t
    Requires Set-Infinite-0.36_07 because new() inheritance has changed
        due to adding dtstart as an object variable
    dtstart() un-deprecated. Is constructor. Adds DTSTART to the set.
    move "print() deprecated" out of the pod.
    move recur_by_rule documentation out of the pod.
